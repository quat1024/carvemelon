# Carved Melons

Adds a Carved Melon and Melon o'Lantern, analogs to the Carved Pumpkin and Jack o'Lantern. But psst, secretly, it's a redstone feature, not just a decorative block!

Very much inspired by this Redditpost: https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/9huxeb/

For 18w50a with Fabric mod loader.

Stuff it does:

* Carve a melon by using shears on it, just like a pumpkin.
* Put said carved melon on your head.
* Or place it on the ground, in 12 different directions.
* Craft it with a Redstone Torch to create the Melon o'Lantern.
* The Melon o'Lantern is not only a stylish, dim light source.
* It also acts as a one-side redstone block.
* Only the melon's face emits a redstone signal.
* Render pumpkin overlay when it's on your head (needs a mixin)

TODO List:

* Properly support rotating my cool special 12-direction block state with e.g. structure blocks.
